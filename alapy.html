<br>
<p>An oasis of fun and frolic right by the side of a vast green-blue expanse, that is how the famed Alappuzha beach welcomes you. The palm-fringed beach, surrounded by lush greenery and historic structures, is a magical combination that serenades you into a land of wonders.

    As the swells of the ocean crash onto the shores and you listen to the gentle whispers of the cool breeze and the rhythmic song of the ocean, get ready to be transported to a tranquil space.
    
    One of the most popular picnic spots in Alappuzha, this beach is famous for an ancient pier and a lighthouse. The pier is over 140 years old and breathes history.  Built by Captain Crawford, this structure gives you a rare experience of walking right into the sea! The old lighthouse here is another fascinating feature that draws people to the beach.
    
    Be it lazing away on the golden sands and finding your moment of quietude, enjoying a sunbath or indulging in countless entertainment activities, Alappuzha Beach has all this and more to satiate the lotus-eater in you.
    
    The Vijaya Beach Park on the beach is a picnic spot that is tailor-made for children. Facilities for boating, riding on a toy train and bicycles are also available here.
    
    The most interesting time to be here is during the New Year bash when the beach bursts with festive fervour. The Sand Art Fest and the Beach fest are events to watch out for. Once here, also keep your ears cocked for sagas and songs that recount the glorious role the district played in the maritime history of Kerala.

<div class="tem"><h1>Kuttanad</h1></div>
<br>
<p>Kuttanad (Malayalam: കുട്ടനാട്‌) is a region covering the Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta Districts, in the state of Kerala, India, well known for its vast paddy fields and geographical peculiarities. The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried on around 1.2 to 3.0 metres (4 to 10 ft) below sea level.[1][2] Kuttanad is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. Farmers of Kuttanad are famous for Biosaline Farming. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) in 2013.

    Four of Kerala's major rivers, the Pamba, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala flow into the region. It is well known for its boat race in the Punnamada Backwaters, known in Malayalam as Vallamkalli.
    
    Kuttanad has no recorded history on the origin of the land. But a blend of myths and legends is transferred from generation to generation orally among local people. Kuttanad was once believed to be a wild forest with dense tree growth which was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire. Chuttanad (place of the burnt forest), was eventually called Kuttanad. Until the recent past burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields). This fact substantiates the theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary are some familiar place names in Kuttanad.</p>
